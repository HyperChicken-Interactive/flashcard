A Swift 3.0 Flashcards App for iOS, by [Whitman Huntley]() and [Donovan Keohane]().

---

## TL;DR

Flashy is a flashcard app for iOS made in Swift 3.0. With it, you will be able to:

* Create your own flashcard sets.
* Save those flashcard sets to your library.
* View those sets of flashcards with only one hand on your iPhone or iPod Touch.
* Customize the app's color scheme.
* I will attempt to publish it to the Apple App Store.

## Technical goals

I have made several technical goals to make sure that this app looks, feels, and acts professionally made such as:

* Use of transitions and animations for swiping the cards, going to the next card, etc.
* Save cards to the memory.
* Be able to make the app work on all iOS devices (excluding the iPad series of course) regardless of size (the app looks the same on iPhone SE, and iPhone 6S+)
* Possibly being able to point to a web address and yank a cardset from it.

## Plans for the future

1. Do the things above.
2. Wow did I get to this step? uhh....
3. `panic()`
